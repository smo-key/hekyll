  "readme": "# Heckle\n\nA minimal [Jekyll][1] clone in node.js.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\n\n## Why?\n\nI like the approach to managing a site taken by Jekyll. A lot.\n\nI don't like Ruby, and I don't like strict logic-less templates.\nJekyll is Ruby with Liquid as the templating engine.\n\nHeckle is JavaScript with Mold (programmable template extravaganza) as\nthe templating engine.\n\n## Setup\n\nDon't use Heckle at this point if you want something stable and\nfinished. It's a work in progress, and may be radically changed or\npitilessly abandoned at any time.\n\nIf that didn't scare you off, you should be able to get dependencies\nwith `npm install`.\n\nWhen the dependencies have been installed, you should be able to\nchange to the directory that contains your blog files, and run...\n\n    nodejs /path/to/heckle/heckle.js\n\nIt parses a `_config.yml` and treats `_posts`, `_layouts`, and\n`_includes` dirs much like [Jekyll][1]. Your templates should be in\n[Mold][3] syntax and read `$arg` rather than `post` or `page` to get\ncontext information.\n\n[3]: http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/mold/\n\nAt some point, more detailed docs, as well as commmand-line arguments,\nmight materialize. For now, read the code, it's (at the time of\nwriting) less than 200 lines.\n",
